One of the things that makes working with the ChatGPT API a little different
from working with, e.g., the <code>davinci-text-003</code> model api is the need to maintain
the history of a given chat session. A Julia <code>Struct</code> containing the chat
history, coupled with a function that acts on that Struct, provides a good way
to work with the ChatGPT API.
</p>

<p>
For the basics of working with the ChatGPT API, check out <a href="20230303-chatgpt-julia.html">part 1</a>.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org523a9df" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org523a9df">Defining the Struct</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org523a9df">
<p>
A <code>struct</code>, also referred to as a <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Composite-Types">composite type</a>, is "a collection of named
fields, an instance of which can be treated as a single value." By default,
structs are immutable: they can't be modified after construction. This doesn't
work for our use case because want to keep adding messages as the chat
continues. So we'll use a <code>mutable struct</code>.
</p>

<p>
One obvious question: what should the named fields of the struct be? Should the
struct define all of the behavior of the model (e.g. model choice, parameters
such as <code>temperature</code> and <code>max_tokens</code>, etc.)? Or should it narrowly contain the
message comprising the chat?
</p>

<p>
I think the latter approach makes the most sense. It's possible to change model
parameters, and even the model itself, mid-chat. They are features of <i>what we
are doing to the chat</i>, not of the chat itself.
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, here is a possible approach to a <code>struct</code> for ChatGPT.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-jupyter-julia">"""
    struct Chat

Represents a conversation between a user and a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT.

# Fields

- `messages::Array{Dict{String, String}}`: An array of dictionaries representing the chat messages.

# Constructors

- `Chat(system_message::String="You are a helpful assistant")`: Create a new `Chat` object with a single system message.

# Example

```julia
chat = Chat("You are a helpful assistant.")
```
This creates a new Chat object with a single message representing the system message "You are a helpful assistant.".
"""

mutable struct Chat
    messages::Array{Dict{String, String}}
    
    function Chat(system_message=nothing)
        if isnothing(system_message)
            system_message = "You are a helpful assistant"
        end
        messages = [Dict("role" =&gt; "system", "content" =&gt; system_message)]
        new(messages)
    end
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This struct includes an <i>inner constructor</i>. <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/constructors/#man-inner-constructor-methods">Inner Constructor Methods</a> allow for
the construction of self-referential objects. In this case, we want to be able
to Initialize an instance of <code>Chat</code> with just the system message: we don't want
to require the user to provide the whole <code>messages</code> array. That's where the
self-referential part comes in. The inner constructor method takes an argument,
<code>system_message</code>, nests it in a properly-formatted array of dictionaries, and,
using the <code>new</code> function, creates a new instance of the <code>Chat</code> struct with the
<code>messages</code> array constructed from the <code>system_message</code>.
</p>

<p>
We can now make a new chat instance, initialized with a system message, with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-jupyter-julia">julia_helper = Chat("You are a helpful assistant who knows a lot about writing Julia code")
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Chat([Dict("role" =&gt; "system", "content" =&gt; "You are a helpful assistant who knows a lot about writing Julia code")])
</pre>


<p>
Now that we have a method for keeping track of the chat history, we need to be
able to act on it. For that, we'll define a function.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga608496" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga608496">Defining the function</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga608496">
<p>
The purpose of this function is to:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get a prompt from the user</li>
<li>Append that prompt to a <code>Chat</code> instance's <code>messages</code> array</li>
<li>Query the ChatGPT API with the <code>messages</code> array, possibly with some parameters
specifying e.g. the specific model to use, temperature, etc.</li>
<li>Append the API response message to the <code>Chat</code> instance's <code>messages</code> array</li>
<li>Return the API response.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This function acts on the <code>Chat</code> type. It modifies an instance of <code>Chat</code> in
place. Here's the function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-jupyter-julia">"""
    chat!(chat, message::String, api_key=ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]; kwargs...)

Add a new message to the chat history and get a response from the OpenAI GPT-3 API.

# Arguments

- `chat`: A `Chat` object representing the chat history.
- `message`: A string representing the user's message.
- `api_key::String=ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`: Your OpenAI API key. If not provided, the function will attempt to get it from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `kwargs...`: Any additional keyword arguments to pass as part of the API request body.

# Returns

A string representing the response from the chatbot.

# Example

```julia
chat = Chat("You are a helpful assistant")
response = chat!(chat, "How are you?")
```

This adds a new message to the Chat object chat, representing the user's message "How are you?", and gets a response from the OpenAI ChatGPT API. The response from the chatbot is returned as a string in the response variable.
"""
function chat!(chat::Chat, message::String, api_key=ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]; kwargs...)
    if isnothing(api_key)
        error("API key is required")
    end
    headers = HTTP.Headers([
        "Authorization" =&gt; "Bearer $api_key",
        "Content-Type" =&gt; "application/json",
    ])

    formatted_query = Dict("role" =&gt; "user", "content" =&gt; message)

    messages = push!(chat.messages, formatted_query)

    # Merge the default and keyword parameters
    params = merge(Dict("model" =&gt; "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages" =&gt; messages), kwargs)

    # Convert the parameters to JSON
    body = json(params)

    # Make a POST request to the OpenAI API endpoint with the query as data
    response = HTTP.post(
        "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        headers,
        body;
        verbose = false,
    )

    # Parse the response body as JSON
    result = JSON.parse(String(response.body))

    # Append the response to chat.messages
    push!(chat.messages, result["choices"][1]["message"])

    # Return the text field of the result as a string
    return result["choices"][1]["message"]["content"]
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A quick note about the function name: According to the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/#bang-convention">Julia style guide</a>, we append <code>!</code>
to the names of functions that modify their arguments. <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/#Write-functions-with-argument-ordering-similar-to-Julia-Base">Furthermore</a>, inputs that
are mutated go before inputs that are not mutated in a function's argument
list. The <code>chat</code> function follows both of these conventions.

So, does it work? Let's try it out.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-jupyter-julia">chat!(julia_helper, "What are the main differences between a Julia Struct and a Python Class?")
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
""Both Julia `struct` and Python `class` are used for creating custom data types, but there are some differences between them:\n\n1. **Type stability:** One of the most significant differences is that Julia `structs` have a static and immutable type, which makes them more type-stable than Python `classes`. In contrast, Python classes are more dynamic, meaning that their attributes can be modified at runtime.\n\n2. **Performance:** In general, Julia `structs` have better performance than Python `classes` due to its type-stability, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and parallel processing.\n\n3. **Syntax:** The syntax for defining a Julia `struct` is `struct Name{T&lt;:AbstractType} a::T b::Int end`, while in Python, you define a `class` with `class MyClass: def __init__(self, a, b): self.a = a self.b = b`. \n\n4. **Inheritance:** Both Julia and Python support inheritance, but they have different syntax and behavior. In Julia, you use the keyword ` &lt;: ` to specify that a `struct` is a subtype of another `struct`. In Python, you use parentheses after the class name to indicate which class to inherit from.\n\n5. **Typing:** Julia uses type annotations to specify the type of variables, while Python follows the duck typing philosophy, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on its behavior.\n\nIn summary, while both Julia `structs` and Python `classes` are flexible and powerful tools for creating custom data types, the main differences lie in their type stability, performance, syntax, inheritance, and typing.""
</pre>


<p>
And does it "remember" earlier parts of the conversation correctly?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-jupyter-julia">chat!(julia_helper, "I only have the attention span for Twitter. Summarize in 280 characters.")
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
"Julia structs &amp; Python classes are used for custom data types but differ in: \n1. Type stability: Julia is static, immutable; Python is dynamic.\n2. Performance: Julia &gt; Python due to type-stability, JIT compilation &amp; parallel processing.\n3. Syntax: structs use \"struct Name{T} a::T end;\" &amp; classes use \"class MyClass: def __init__(self):\".\n4. Inheritance: Julia uses \"&lt;:\" to specify subtypes; Python uses parentheses for inheritance.\n5. Typing: Julia uses type annotation; Python uses duck-typing."

<p>
Well, it's a little longer than I asked for. But clearly we successfully sent
the message history in the second API request.

<h2 id="org4fc00a3">What's next?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4fc00a3">
<p>
There are a few additional avenues I want to explore, in no particular order:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What happens if we counterfeit a message history? That is, what if we send a
message history with fake "assistant" messages? Will the assistant mimic the
fake responses?</li>
<li>Can we make a Julia REPL mode that gives rapid access to a ChatGPT assistant?</li>
<li>Can we make a (private) replacement for ChatGPT Plus using the ChatGPT API?
It would likely be considerably cheaper. And doing it in Julia would be an
interesting project.</li>
<li>Can we use the streaming output in Julia? How does that work?</li>
