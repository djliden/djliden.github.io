My name is Dan. I'm a data scientist at <a href="https://bit.io">bit.io</a>, where we offer the fastest and easiest way to get a
secure, private PostgreSQL database. In this role, I write and I work on internal analytics.

<p>
Prior to starting at bit.io, I was the Director of Data Analytics at the Guinn Center for Policy Priorities in Las Vegas, Nevada. In this role, I was responsible for conducting data-driven policy analysis and for supporting ongoing research and data analysis at the Guinn Center.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org69ecc08">
<p>
I noticed that some of the formatting on this site was a little off and some of
the org-mode components weren't being translated to HTML in quite the way I
expected. Fixing this was simple, but <i>finding</i> the solution wasn't. In short, it
was necessary to set the <code>org-html-doctype</code> to <code>html5</code> (the default is
<code>xhtml-strict</code>). Furthermore, I set <code>org-html-html5-fancy</code> to <code>t</code>. These ensure the
org export process takes advantage of block elements offered in the <code>html5</code>
standard.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org50a1291">
<p>
When writing about org mode, one often wants to show what particular org
headline look like in terms of formatting, properties, tags, options,
etc,. However, even within a babel org source block, an org header will be
parsed and exported as a header. We can get around this by prepending the
headline with a comma. The comma won't show up when exported: all that is
exported is a nicely-formatted example of an org headline.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4004bdc">
<p>
I recently started using org-mode to keep track of a few habits (morning
meditation, getting some sunlight and exercise before my morning coffee, etc.)
and needed to make use of org-mode's calendar features to do so. I've previously
set deadlines and scheduled dates for my <code>TODO</code> entries, but have seldom used
repeat intervals. My early attempts ( <code>date +1d</code>) worked fine but required some
extra steps if I ever missed a day. This post discusses the <code>.+</code> and <code>++</code>
-style repeat intervals, which allow more control over what happens when you
complete a task after the scheduled date.

<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html">Org Babel</a> is one of the best tools available for <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html">literate programming</a>. As a data scientist, I use it
as a plain-text alternative to Jupyter notebooks. Org-mode files are much easier to track with
version control and don't require the overhead of a browser. There are tradeoffs: Jupyter notebooks
handle the display of different types of output (text results, images, interactive figures, etc.) in
a way that is both seamless and visually appealing. Displaying figures at all can be a challenge
when getting started with org-babel. This post covers the basics of using org-babel for common data
