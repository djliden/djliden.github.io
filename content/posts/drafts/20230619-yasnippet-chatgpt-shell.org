The wonderful [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]] package lets you interact with the gpt-3.5 and gpt-4
APIs in emacs via a handy shell built on top of ~comint-mode~. It also integrates
well with ~org-mode~.

I find that I tend to re-use a few prompt patterns for specific tasks. Yasnippet provides a great
way to create prompt /templates/ made up of some fixed component with placeholders
for user input. I can easily insert these prompt templates when working with
~chatgpt-shell~ to gain easy access to reusable, task-specific prompts. This post
describes how to start using Yasnippet for prompt templates for use with
~chatgpt-shell~.
