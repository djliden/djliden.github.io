/Another one from the archives--this is one of my projects from my time at the Guinn Center, and something I very much wish I could have developed further: an analysis of urban heat in Las Vegas./

** Background
For the past several months, I have been working on an analysis on the effects
of urban heat on vulnerable populations, particularly during a public health
crisis. For some background, I currently live in Las Vegas, where summer heat
can exceed 110 degrees. Last summer included a 45-day-long streak of
temperatures over 100 degrees.

Urban heat is not distributed evenly within cities. Features such as parks or
ponds can lead to cooler temperatures in some areas, while areas without foliage
or with dark surfaces such as roads and buildings lead to warmer
temperatures. This effect is particularly pronounced at night: urban surfaces
absorb heat during the daytime, warming the air at night.

An NPR Special Series titled [[https://www.npr.org/series/756048128/urban-heat][Heat and Health in American Cities]] compared urban
heat to household income in the 100 most populated cities. They found that, in
many cities, income and urban heat were inversely related: lower-income
households tended to be in the parts of cities most affected by urban heat,
while higher-income households were more often found in cooler areas.

The key to this research was aggregating urban heat data within census
boundaries (such as tracts or blocks). I decided to recreate this analysis in
~R~. Once urban heat data is linked to Census-designated boundaries, it can easily
be compared to metrics such as income, poverty, disability, access to health
insurance, demographics, any many other data points collected by the U.S. Census
Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). In R, obtaining and mapping these
metrics is a relatively simple process with packages such as ~tidycensus~ and
~tigris~.

The remainder of this post will provide a very brief overview of how to obtain
satellite surface temperature data; aggregate those data points within census
tracts; and plot the results. I don't know if this mapping exercise will make it
into the final project report, but I learned a lot from working through it, and
I wanted to make sure to document my steps here.

Though it should be possible to follow this guide without much prior experience
working with spatial data, [[https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/][This free book]], /Geocomputation with R/ by Robin
Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow, is an excellent resource for those
interested in learning more. It is particularly useful for understanding topics
such as /projections/ and the differences between raster and vector data. The
section on [[https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html#raster-vector][Raster-vector interactions]] is particularly relevant to this task as
we will be taking raster values (the heat map) and aggregating them within
polygon boundaries (census tracts).

** Getting the Data
I obtained surface temperature satellite data from the NASA/USGS Landsat 8
satellite. The data can be obtained through an API, though for this example, I
downloaded the data manually. I looked for data meeting the following criteria:
- From June-August 2020
- Cloud cover less than 4%
- Landsat C1 Analysis-Ready Data (ARD) datasets
- I ultimately downloaded a raster map with ID
  ~LC08_CU_005011_20200806_20200824_C01_V01~. This map came from 06
  August, 2020. Details, including a download link, can be found [[https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/scene/metadata/full/5e83a38b677b457d/LC08_CU_005011_20200806_C01_V01/][here]].

So what data did we actually obtain? Downloading the "Provisional Land Surface
Temperature" file returns a ~.tar~ file with a number of ~.tif~ raster images. We're
interested in the one with ~ST.tif~ at the end (ST for Surface Temperature). This
provides a raster map of the region, at 30-meter spatial resolution, with
surface temperatures in tenths of a degree Kelvin. That is, each 30-meter "cell"
in the map is associated with a surface temperature value.

*** Unpacking and Visualizing the Raw Data
This section requires the ~raster~ and ~sf~ packages. Below, we untar the map and
extract the map of interest.

#+begin_src R :session sat :results graphics file
library(raster)
library(sf)

## untar the data
untar(tarfile = "PATH-TO-TARFILE.tar", exdir = "DESTINATION-DIRECTORY")
file.copy("./data/raw/testsat/LC08_CU_005011_20200806_20200824_C01_V01_ST.tif",
          "IMAGE-DESTINATION/st_map.tif")

## Access the file as a raster image, plot, and save as png
st_map = raster("./data/processed/st_map.tif")
png(file = "./figs/st_map.png")
plot(st_map)
dev.off()
#+end_src

#+begin_center

#+end_center

Starting from this map, we want to (1) crop to the area immediately surrounding
Las Vegas, and (2) average the temperature values within each census tract,
allowing us to compare tract-level surface temperatures to other data collected
at the census tract level.

** Mapping Heat by Census Tract
First, we'll use the ~tigris~ package to download the census tract boundaries in
Nevada and crop to the Las Vegas area.


#+begin_src R :session sat :results graphics file
lv_tracts <- tigris::tracts(state="NV") %>%
  st_crop(xmin=-115.38, ymin=35.92, xmax = -114.88, ymax = 36.38) 
#+end_src

Next, we'll reproject our tract-level data such that it has the same projection
as the raster data. Computationally, transforming vector data (our tract data)
is much less expensive than transforming raster data. After reprojecting, we can
use the ~crop~ function from the ~raster~ package to crop the raster image to the
Las Vegas area as defined in ~lv_tracts~.


#+begin_src R :session sat :results graphics file
lv_tracts_reprojected = st_transform(lv_racts, crs(st_map))
sat_cropped = crop(st_map, lv_tracts_reprojected)
#+end_src

With this accomplished, we use the ~raster::extract()~ function to extract the
mean of the raster values within the boundaries defined by
~lv_tracts_reprojected~, which contains the census tract boundaries projected to
align with the raster map.

#+begin_src R :session sat
heat_map = extract(sat_cropped,           # cropped raster object
                   lv_tracts_reprojected, # vector map of LV
                   df=TRUE,               # return as data frame
                   fun=mean,              # return the mean of each polygon
                   sp=TRUE)               # append to lv_tracts_reprojected

## Visualize
sf_heat_map = st_as_sf(heat_map)          # Convert to simple features (sf) vector data
png(file="IMAGE_DESTINATION/heatmaptest.png")
plot(out["st_map"])                       # plot the column of raster values
dev.off()
#+end_src

#+begin_center
#+CAPTION: Average Surface Temperatures by Census Tract in Las Vegas, Nevada (tenths of a degree Kelvin)
[[./figures/20210213-urban-heat/heatmaptest.png]]
#+end_center

We're closer to our goal, but not quite there yet. Our map is rotated, and the
scale (tenths of a degree Kelvin) isn't especially interpretable. First, we'll
reproject the map to the correct orientation (back to the original projection of
the census tract data).

#+begin_src R :session sat
  heat_tracts_transformed = st_transform(x=sf_heat_map, crs = crs(lv_tracts))
  png("tract_repro.png")
  plot(heat_tracts_transformed["st_map"])
  dev.off()
#+end_src

#+begin_center
#+CAPTION: Re-projected Map of Surface Temperatures by Census Tract
[[./figures/20210213-urban-heat/tract_repro.png]]
#+end_center

** Final Maps

Lastly, we can apply some formatting to make it more interpretable. I used
~ggplot2~ for all of the visual tweaks (details not shown).

#+begin_center
#+CAPTION: Visualizing Urban Heat by Census Tract in Las Vegas, Nevada
[[./figures/20210213-urban-heat/ST_LV.png]]
#+end_center

We can now plot other metrics by census tract and visually compare them to our
urban heat map. For example, we can look at poverty by census tract:

#+begin_center
#+CAPTION: Poverty by Census Tract in Las Vegas, Nevada
[[./figures/20210213-urban-heat/poverty.png]]
#+end_center

A quick visual inspection of these two maps shows that the Sunrise Manor and
Winchester areas have relatively high temperatures and a high proportion of
residents living abelow the poverty line. Conversely, the Summerlin area on the
west side of Las Vegas has among the lowest temperatures and the lowest rates of
poverty.

There are plenty of additional analyses we can conduct from here. The NPR report
linked above calculated correlations between tract-level surface temperatures
and household incomes to determine that the two were inversely correlated. There
are also a variety of [[https://maczokni.github.io/crimemapping_textbook_bookdown/spatial-regression-models.html][spatial regression models]] and [[https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-cv.html][statistical learning/machine
learning]] techniques that can be applied to spatial data. Understanding how to
connect different sources of spatial data -- such as the census tracts and heat
data above -- is an important first step to conducting these analyses.
