#+TITLE: Figures and Captions Don't Appear as Expected with Default Export Options
#+DATE: <2022-07-24 Sun>


#+begin_preview
I noticed that some of the formatting on this site was a little off and some of
the org-mode components weren't being translated to HTML in quite the way I
expected. Fixing this was simple, but /finding/ the solution wasn't. In short, it
was necessary to set the ~org-html-doctype~ to ~html5~ (the default is
~xhtml-strict~). Furthermore, I set ~org-html-html5-fancy~ to ~t~. These ensure the
org export process takes advantage of block elements offered in the ~html5~
standard.
#+end_preview

While that brief introduction should capture the necessary changes, we can get
into more specifics.

* The Problem

If we use the default settings, figures aren't wrapped in ~<figure>~ blocks and
captions aren't wrapped in ~<figcaption>~ blocks, so none of the formatting we
want to see applied to those attributes is actually applied. Here's what we see:

#+begin_export html
<div id="org7d55a3b" class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/20220719-julia-plots/fig5.png" alt="fig5.png" width="450px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>This caption is left-aligned and has no <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element</p>
</div>
#+end_export

The image and caption appear left-aligned on the page. Here's the html:

#+begin_src html
<div id="org7d55a3b" class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/20220719-julia-plots/fig5.png" alt="fig5.png" width="450px">
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>This caption is left-aligned and has no <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element</p>
</div>
#+end_src

* Changes to the Site Config

To address this, we need to change the ~org-html-doctype~ and ~org-html-html5-fancy~
variables. We can do this in the export configuration's
~org-publish-project-alist~. See [[https://github.com/djliden/djliden.github.io/blob/main/build-site.el][here]] for the updated configuration file. Here is
what the updated ~org-publish-project-alist~ looks likeâ€”see lines 21-22 for the
key changes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp -n
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list
       (list "org-site:main"
             :recursive t
             :base-directory "./content"
             :publishing-directory "./public"
             :publishing-function 'org-html-publish-to-html
             :html-preamble (file-contents "assets/html_preamble.html")
             :with-author nil
             :with-creator t
             :with-toc t
             :section-numbers nil
             :time-stamp-file nil
             :auto-sitemap t
             :sitemap-title nil;"Daniel Liden's Blog"
             :sitemap-format-entry 'my/org-publish-org-sitemap-format
             :sitemap-function 'my/org-publish-org-sitemap
             :sitemap-sort-files 'anti-chronologically
             :sitemap-filename "sitemap.org"
             :sitemap-style 'tree
             :html-doctype "html5"
             :html-html5-fancy t)
       (list "org-site:static"
             :base-directory "./content/"
             :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf\\|svg"
             :publishing-directory "./public"
             :recursive t
             :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment
             )
       (list "org-site:assets"
             :base-directory "./assets/"
             :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf"
             :publishing-directory "./public/"
             :recursive t
             :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment)))
#+end_src
* The Results

With these changes, our images and captions are now centered:

#+CAPTION: This caption is now centered and wrapped in a ~<figcaption>~ tag!
#+attr_html: :width 450px
[[file:figures/20220719-julia-plots/fig5.png]]

And the html generated from the org export now looks like this:

#+begin_src html
<figure id="orgbffad64">
<img src="figures/20220719-julia-plots/fig5.png" alt="fig5.png" width="450px">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>This caption is now centered and wrapped in a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag!</figcaption>
</figure>
#+end_src

We now have a ~<figure>...</figure>~ block and our caption is a ~<figcaption>~
element.

As noted in [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.html][this Worg page]]:

#+begin_quote
There is no /figure/ element in XHTML and captions are not supported at all.
#+end_quote

Setting the config to use ~html5~ gives us access to these elements.

*Note*: I don't know much HTML or CSS at all. It probably shows. I was trying to
 apply some formatting to the ~figcaption~ element in my stylesheet and it wasn't
 having any impact, even though I was pretty sure captions were supposed to
 export to ~figcaption~. That led me to this solution, which seems to work well
 (for now). I invite any feedback!
