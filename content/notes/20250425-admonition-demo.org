Quick walkthrough of the site’s new callout styling for Org blocks: see the raw markup, the rendered result, and the tiny bit of CSS/JS that makes it work.
#+end_preview

* Why
I keep reaching for Org special blocks (~#+begin_note~, ~#+begin_warning~, etc.) when I want callouts. This update gives them a consistent look across light and dark themes without much effort.

* Examples
Each example shows the Org snippet first, followed by how it renders after export.

** Note
#+begin_src org
#+begin_note
Use notes for context or references that amplify the main text.
#+end_note
#+end_src

#+begin_note
Use notes for context or references that amplify the main text.
#+end_note

** Tip
#+begin_src org
#+begin_tip
Tips are great for quick wins, shortcuts, or “you might not know” details.
#+end_tip
#+end_src

#+begin_tip
Tips are great for quick wins, shortcuts, or “you might not know” details.
#+end_tip

** Warning
#+begin_src org
#+begin_warning
Warnings (and ~#+begin_caution~ / ~#+begin_important~) announce risky steps or footguns.
#+end_warning
#+end_src

#+begin_warning
Warnings (and =#+begin_caution= / =#+begin_important=) announce risky steps or footguns.
#+end_warning

* How it Works
- Styling lives in ~assets/orgstyle.css~ (~.admonition~, ~.admonition--warn~, etc.).
- A tiny helper script ~assets/admonitions.js~ looks for exported ~<div class="note">~ style blocks and wraps them with a title, icon, and proper roles.
- No extra Org boilerplate—write the block and the theme handles the rest.

* Using It
1. Add a special block to your Org file, e.g. ~#+begin_tip~ … ~#+end_tip~.
2. Run =./build.sh= so the helper script and CSS land in the generated HTML.
3. Preview the page in both themes to check contrast (the colors adapt automatically).

That’s it. Drop these into any post where a little extra emphasis helps the reader.
