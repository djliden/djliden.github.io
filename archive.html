<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2066b4b">
<p>
The wonderful <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell">chatgpt-shell</a> package lets you interact with the gpt-3.5 and gpt-4
APIs in emacs via a handy shell built on top of <code>comint-mode</code>. It also integrates
well with <code>org-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
I find that I tend to re-use a few prompt patterns for specific tasks. Yasnippet provides a great
way to create prompt <i>templates</i> made up of some fixed component with placeholders
for user input. I can easily insert these prompt templates when working with
<code>chatgpt-shell</code> to gain easy access to reusable, task-specific prompts. This post
describes how to start using Yasnippet for prompt templates for use with
<code>chatgpt-shell</code>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0a4ffb9">
<p>
Since this start of this year, I've been working on and writing about AI tools
for working with Postgres databases. Most of this work has involved finding
different ways to integrate ChatGPT (and previously Codex) with other tools and
workflows. I wanted to collect and share some of that writing here, as it's
related to a lot of the other things I write about on my personal blog.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc5b191d">
<p>
One of the things that makes working with the ChatGPT API a little different
from working with, e.g., the <code>davinci-text-003</code> model api is the need to maintain
the history of a given chat session. A Julia <code>Struct</code> containing the chat
history, coupled with a function that acts on that Struct, provides a good way
to work with the ChatGPT API.

<p>
This brief post shows the basics of using the Julia <code>HTTP</code> library to interact

will only include the minimum necessary detail for getting started with the
API. Future posts will go into a little more detail on how to send message
histories and engage more interactively with the API.

<p>
The latest release of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">Denote</a> (by the inimitable Protesilaos Stavrou) introduced
support for <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-30-demo-denote-custom-file-type/">custom file types</a> in addition to the defaults, Org, Markdown+YAML,
Markdown+TOML, and plain text. This post shows how to add <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> files
(.qmd). Quarto, the successor to R Markdown, is "an open-source scientific and
technical publishing system" with support for Python, R, Julia, and
Observable. The setup detailed here will allow one to choose the .qmd filetype
when creating a new Denote file.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org695b9f2">
<p>
There are countless ways of processing JSON data and converting it to different
formats. Historically, I've used Python and loaded the data into a Pandas
Dataframe for processing. This isn't really necessary for simple tasks,
though. Sometimes, a lightweight command line tool does the job just fine. Enter
<code>jq</code>. <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is "like <code>sed</code> for JSON data." This post walks through an example of
downloading data from an API, extracting a few fields based on some conditions,
and converting the results to a CSV using <code>jq</code>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd6010fe">
<p>
I noticed that some of the formatting on this site was a little off and some of
the org-mode components weren't being translated to HTML in quite the way I
expected. Fixing this was simple, but <i>finding</i> the solution wasn't. In short, it
was necessary to set the <code>org-html-doctype</code> to <code>html5</code> (the default is
<code>xhtml-strict</code>). Furthermore, I set <code>org-html-html5-fancy</code> to <code>t</code>. These ensure the
org export process takes advantage of block elements offered in the <code>html5</code>
standard.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfea3183">
<p>
When writing about org mode, one often wants to show what particular org
headline look like in terms of formatting, properties, tags, options,
etc,. However, even within a babel org source block, an org header will be
parsed and exported as a header. We can get around this by prepending the
headline with a comma. The comma won't show up when exported: all that is
exported is a nicely-formatted example of an org headline.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc14c4f8">
<p>
I recently started using org-mode to keep track of a few habits (morning
meditation, getting some sunlight and exercise before my morning coffee, etc.)
and needed to make use of org-mode's calendar features to do so. I've previously
set deadlines and scheduled dates for my <code>TODO</code> entries, but have seldom used
repeat intervals. My early attempts ( <code>date +1d</code>) worked fine but required some
extra steps if I ever missed a day. This post discusses the <code>.+</code> and <code>++</code>
-style repeat intervals, which allow more control over what happens when you
complete a task after the scheduled date.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3a76f0b">
<p>
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html">Org Babel</a> is one of the best tools available for <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html">literate programming</a>. As a data scientist, I use it
as a plain-text alternative to Jupyter notebooks. Org-mode files are much easier to track with
version control and don't require the overhead of a browser. There are tradeoffs: Jupyter notebooks
handle the display of different types of output (text results, images, interactive figures, etc.) in
a way that is both seamless and visually appealing. Displaying figures at all can be a challenge
when getting started with org-babel. This post covers the basics of using org-babel for common data
science tasks in R.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge425ad6">
<p>
I finally made a personal site using org-mode's built-in <code>ox-publish</code> exporter.
</p>

<p>
I've written my personal website with org-mode for years (it is, after all, <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/">one of the most
reasonable markup languages to use for text</a>). But until this point, I've used Hugo (with the <code>ox-Hugo</code>
exporter). It worked fine, but it always seemed <i>just a little bit too complicated</i> for my needs. I
wanted to find something where I could basically understand all of the components and where the gap
between my org-mode files and the published output was as small as possible. I wanted to focus more
on the writing and less on understanding the framework.
