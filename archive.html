<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7dc7931">
<p>
I use denote's <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92">journaling features</a> to keep a daily project log, where I record whatever I'm working on, stray bits of knowledge, some TODOs, fleeting thoughts, etc.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, I want to refer back to these notes. But I (will) have a lot of these journal files. I don't want to search through them manually to find the name of that article, or that recommendation I jotted down, or whatever it was.
</p>

<p>
This post shows a quick solution to this issue using <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.html">org-agenda-custom-commands</a> to make a custom view over specified tags in my journal files.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org503f649">

I was looking for a good dataset to use for comparing different models in a RAG application when I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bpo5uo/rag_benchmark_of_databricksdbrx/">this post</a> on Reddit. It compares a bunch of models on a collection of questions over a set of documents provided by <a href="https://h2o.ai">H2O.ai</a>.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't super interested in the benchmark, but the files (mostly pdfs, one mp3, jpg, other file types) interested me for use in my own testing. This short post shows how to get them using the scripts provided by h2o.ai.

This short post shows how to use the <code>org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift</code> command to make org headings for recurring tasks.

Today I was customizing the appearance of org files displayed with <a href="https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide">org-tree-slide</a>. In particular, I wanted to increase the font size and start <a href="https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti">Olivetti mode</a> whenever I started <code>org-tree-slide-mode</code> and return everything to normal when I was done. This, I quickly discovered, required the use of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html">hooks</a>. Hooks are not especially complicated, but they are useful and worth taking a few minutes to understand. This post will cover the basics of working with hooks in emacs.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbdaf9fa">
<p>
The wonderful <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell">chatgpt-shell</a> package by <a href="https://github.com/xenodium">Xenodium</a> lets you interact with the gpt-3.5 and gpt-4
APIs in emacs via a handy shell built on top of <code>comint-mode</code>. It also integrates
well with <code>org-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
I find that I tend to re-use a few prompt patterns for specific tasks. Yasnippet provides a great
way to create prompt <i>templates</i> made up of some fixed component with placeholders
for user input. I can easily insert these prompt templates when working with
<code>chatgpt-shell</code> to gain easy access to reusable, task-specific prompts. This post
describes how to start using Yasnippet for prompt templates for use with
<code>chatgpt-shell</code>.

<p>
Since this start of this year, I've been working on and writing about AI tools
for working with Postgres databases. Most of this work has involved finding
different ways to integrate ChatGPT (and previously Codex) with other tools and

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org102bb6e">
<p>
One of the things that makes working with the ChatGPT API a little different
from working with, e.g., the <code>davinci-text-003</code> model api is the need to maintain
the history of a given chat session. A Julia <code>Struct</code> containing the chat
history, coupled with a function that acts on that Struct, provides a good way
to work with the ChatGPT API.

The latest release of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">Denote</a> (by the inimitable Protesilaos Stavrou) introduced

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org53cfcc1">
<p>
There are countless ways of processing JSON data and converting it to different
formats. Historically, I've used Python and loaded the data into a Pandas
Dataframe for processing. This isn't really necessary for simple tasks,
though. Sometimes, a lightweight command line tool does the job just fine. Enter
<code>jq</code>. <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is "like <code>sed</code> for JSON data." This post walks through an example of
downloading data from an API, extracting a few fields based on some conditions,
and converting the results to a CSV using <code>jq</code>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5d28fb8">
<p>
I noticed that some of the formatting on this site was a little off and some of
the org-mode components weren't being translated to HTML in quite the way I
expected. Fixing this was simple, but <i>finding</i> the solution wasn't. In short, it
was necessary to set the <code>org-html-doctype</code> to <code>html5</code> (the default is
<code>xhtml-strict</code>). Furthermore, I set <code>org-html-html5-fancy</code> to <code>t</code>. These ensure the
org export process takes advantage of block elements offered in the <code>html5</code>
standard.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4ddae15">
<p>
When writing about org mode, one often wants to show what particular org
headline look like in terms of formatting, properties, tags, options,
etc,. However, even within a babel org source block, an org header will be
parsed and exported as a header. We can get around this by prepending the
headline with a comma. The comma won't show up when exported: all that is
exported is a nicely-formatted example of an org headline.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org366f865">
<p>
I recently started using org-mode to keep track of a few habits (morning
meditation, getting some sunlight and exercise before my morning coffee, etc.)
and needed to make use of org-mode's calendar features to do so. I've previously
set deadlines and scheduled dates for my <code>TODO</code> entries, but have seldom used
repeat intervals. My early attempts ( <code>date +1d</code>) worked fine but required some
extra steps if I ever missed a day. This post discusses the <code>.+</code> and <code>++</code>
-style repeat intervals, which allow more control over what happens when you
complete a task after the scheduled date.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfb91900">
<p>
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html">Org Babel</a> is one of the best tools available for <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html">literate programming</a>. As a data scientist, I use it
as a plain-text alternative to Jupyter notebooks. Org-mode files are much easier to track with
version control and don't require the overhead of a browser. There are tradeoffs: Jupyter notebooks
handle the display of different types of output (text results, images, interactive figures, etc.) in
a way that is both seamless and visually appealing. Displaying figures at all can be a challenge
when getting started with org-babel. This post covers the basics of using org-babel for common data
science tasks in R.

I finally made a personal site using org-mode's built-in <code>ox-publish</code> exporter.

<p>
I've written my personal website with org-mode for years (it is, after all, <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/">one of the most
reasonable markup languages to use for text</a>). But until this point, I've used Hugo (with the <code>ox-Hugo</code>
exporter). It worked fine, but it always seemed <i>just a little bit too complicated</i> for my needs. I
wanted to find something where I could basically understand all of the components and where the gap
between my org-mode files and the published output was as small as possible. I wanted to focus more
on the writing and less on understanding the framework.
