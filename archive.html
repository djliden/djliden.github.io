<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org81837e9">
<p>
The latest release of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">Denote</a> (by the inimitable Protesilaos Stavrou) introduced
support for <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-30-demo-denote-custom-file-type/">custom file types</a> in addition to the defaults, Org, Markdown+YAML,
Markdown+TOML, and plain text. This post shows how to add <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> files
(.qmd). Quarto, the successor to R Markdown, is "an open-source scientific and
technical publishing system" with support for Python, R, Julia, and
Observable. The setup detailed here will allow one to choose the .qmd filetype
when creating a new Denote file.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgee354ef">
<p>
There are countless ways of processing JSON data and converting it to different
formats. Historically, I've used Python and loaded the data into a Pandas
Dataframe for processing. This isn't really necessary for simple tasks,
though. Sometimes, a lightweight command line tool does the job just fine. Enter
<code>jq</code>. <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is "like <code>sed</code> for JSON data." This post walks through an example of
downloading data from an API, extracting a few fields based on some conditions,
and converting the results to a CSV using <code>jq</code>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb999039">
<p>
I noticed that some of the formatting on this site was a little off and some of
the org-mode components weren't being translated to HTML in quite the way I
expected. Fixing this was simple, but <i>finding</i> the solution wasn't. In short, it
was necessary to set the <code>org-html-doctype</code> to <code>html5</code> (the default is
<code>xhtml-strict</code>). Furthermore, I set <code>org-html-html5-fancy</code> to <code>t</code>. These ensure the
org export process takes advantage of block elements offered in the <code>html5</code>
standard.

<h2 id="orgc2c2b3b"><a href="posts/20220208-org-source.html">(2022-02-08) Org Mode Headlines in Org Source Blocks</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc2c2b3b">
<p>
When writing about org mode, one often wants to show what particular org
headline look like in terms of formatting, properties, tags, options,
etc,. However, even within a babel org source block, an org header will be
parsed and exported as a header. We can get around this by prepending the
headline with a comma. The comma won't show up when exported: all that is
exported is a nicely-formatted example of an org headline.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5926f09">
<p>
I recently started using org-mode to keep track of a few habits (morning
meditation, getting some sunlight and exercise before my morning coffee, etc.)
and needed to make use of org-mode's calendar features to do so. I've previously
set deadlines and scheduled dates for my <code>TODO</code> entries, but have seldom used
repeat intervals. My early attempts ( <code>date +1d</code>) worked fine but required some
extra steps if I ever missed a day. This post discusses the <code>.+</code> and <code>++</code>
-style repeat intervals, which allow more control over what happens when you
complete a task after the scheduled date.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org46b0e85">
<p>
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html">Org Babel</a> is one of the best tools available for <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html">literate programming</a>. As a data scientist, I use it
as a plain-text alternative to Jupyter notebooks. Org-mode files are much easier to track with
version control and don't require the overhead of a browser. There are tradeoffs: Jupyter notebooks
handle the display of different types of output (text results, images, interactive figures, etc.) in
a way that is both seamless and visually appealing. Displaying figures at all can be a challenge
when getting started with org-babel. This post covers the basics of using org-babel for common data
science tasks in R.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org14e9a91">
<p>
I finally made a personal site using org-mode's built-in <code>ox-publish</code> exporter.
</p>

<p>
I've written my personal website with org-mode for years (it is, after all, <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/">one of the most
reasonable markup languages to use for text</a>). But until this point, I've used Hugo (with the <code>ox-Hugo</code>
exporter). It worked fine, but it always seemed <i>just a little bit too complicated</i> for my needs. I
wanted to find something where I could basically understand all of the components and where the gap
between my org-mode files and the published output was as small as possible. I wanted to focus more
on the writing and less on understanding the framework.

them for some time.
